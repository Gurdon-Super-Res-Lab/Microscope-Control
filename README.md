# Microscope-Control
Modular microscope control in LabView for camera based systems primarily used for 4Pi-SMS imaging as described in [Huang et al. Cell 166, 1028â€“1040 (2016)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.06.016). This package uses a modular approach to make adding or changing functionality and/or hardware simpler.

# Software Requirements
* NI LabVIEW 2016, 64-bit
* NI Device Drivers (DAQmx and VISA are required)
* NI Vision Development Module

Due to third party camera driver limitations we are stuck on LabVIEW for 2016 for the moment.
