This device engine uses PVCam from Photometrics.

Be sure to install PVCam on your computer first.

After you install PVCam, copy the file "LabVIEW.exe.config" to the base installation directory for LabView.

For example, copy "LabVIEW.exe.config" to "C:\Program Files\National Instruments\LabVIEW 2018".

"LabVIEW.exe.config" is a text file (can be opened in Notepad for example) that tells LabView its okay to load
external libraries. This is required otherwise LabView will not load PVCam and the Prime BSI camera engine
will not run.
